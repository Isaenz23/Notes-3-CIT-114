IP addresses are normally expressed in dotted-decimal format, with four numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.123.132. 
If a TCP/IP computer needs to communicate with a host on another network, it will usually communicate through a device called a router.
TCP/IP network problems are often caused by incorrect configuration of the three main entries in a computer's TCP/IP properties. 
IP addresses enable resources in your VPC to communicate with each other, and with resources over the Internet. Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC support the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing protocols.
An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.
internet is tens of thousands kilometres of fiber optic cable, hundreds of thousands to millions of kilometres of copper wire, and hardware and software connecting them all together in a redundant, fast, and self-sufficient network.
Don Pezet likens talking to computers like speaking to someone there are protocols so computers are the same way.
Don Pezet says all computers speak the same language now which is TCP/IP.
What I learned is that all computers used to speak different languages but now they speak the same language which is TCP/IP.  I also learned that it is wise to check a computer's TCP/IP properties when troubleshooting a network.
